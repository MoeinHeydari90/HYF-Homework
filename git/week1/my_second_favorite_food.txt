Fesenjan, also known as fesenjoon, is a traditional Persian dish featuring a rich and tangy sauce made from pomegranate molasses and ground walnuts, typically served with chicken or duck. Here's a simple recipe:



Ingredients:

1 lb (450g) chicken pieces (thighs or breasts)
2 cups ground walnuts
1 cup pomegranate molasses
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon sugar (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste


Instructions:

In a large pot, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and saut√© until golden brown.
Add chicken pieces to the pot and brown them on all sides.
Stir in ground walnuts and cook for a few minutes until fragrant.
Pour in pomegranate molasses and enough water to cover the chicken.
Season with salt, pepper, and sugar (if using). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 1 to 1.5 hours until the chicken is tender and the sauce has thickened.
Adjust seasoning if needed and serve hot with steamed rice.
